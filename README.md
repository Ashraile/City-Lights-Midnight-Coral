# City-Lights-Midnight-Coral
Custom IDE theme for Atom made for extensive nighttime coding without eye strain. [Public Domain]

### Instructions

1. Open Atom -> File -> Settings -> Install

  Select [Themes] if the [Packages] button is highlighted.
  In the search bar, search for and install these two themes: 
    `city-lights-ui 1.5.3` and
    `city-lights-syntax 1.1.8`
    
2. Once installed, go to the Themes icon (in between Packages and Updates, where it shows the paint roller icon).
   Under the "UI Theme" and "Syntax Theme" dropdowns, select "`City Lights`" for both.
   
3. Once that is done, go to File -> Stylesheet.


   Replace the default `styles.less` file with the one from this repository.
